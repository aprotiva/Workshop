In this article, Blumenstock describes some of the possible advantages, as well as problems with utilizing big data. I will start out with what stuck with me. Technology and phone data has many possibilities in relation to human development. It can be used for geological mapping, identifying wealthy and poor communities, and much more, though it is biased. Blumenstock makes the argument that data science and human development doesn't benefit underdeveloped areas and countries. The less developed would not have access to the technology, making analysis biased toward those who do. In addition, the less developed can't use the information as well. Even with these hinderances, certain kinds of analysis can produce very useful data, especially with newer, better, and more data being collected. I got a sense that Blumenstock sees that if rushed, data used for international development will fail. This does not mean it will not be effective, but not as effective as it could have been. Sole analysis of data is always incomplete. Human existence is too complicated to be represented as numbers and data, but it can be modled. In a similar way, international development should not be dictated by numbers and data, but could be lead by it. At the current time, I feel like there is not enough data in many fields to be making decisions based on it. When problems do arise, it can lead to change in thinking.
