The technique used in this paper was the random forest method. It utilyzes course data in combination with covariate data such as land cover, elevation, night lights, slope, distance to water, distance to hospital, and things like that in order to predict population density. 

This is what is known as a machine learning algorithm because it generates different maps using different weights, then compares them to other data, and finds the best solution that it can. It does this all automatically and is a part of the method. The difference between this and statistical models is that this activley utilyzes more datasets and uses more prediction rather than simply using the data statistically. 

Some of the covariates used in the model were proximity to hospitals, proximity to water, land cover, slope, and other things. These data-sets are glabal data that can be integrated into any models anywhere around the world. Because of the availability of this big data, the models created can be more acurate. 

In relation to how this can aid in solving human development problems, higher precision of data allows for more effective solutions. Especially in LMICs, poor data leads to bias because the full picture is not being looked at. With high precision of data, the most effective solutions, or problems, can be identified. 

In relation to my own project, this has a multitude of implications. In Tajikistan, the rural areas are significantly less developed than the urban areas. The data from the rural areas is certainly not as acurate, and policies implemented that target rural areas are not effective. Using geospacial covariates in a random forest method could have significant impact on data, especially since the terrain of Tajikistan is fairly chaotic. Allowing machine learning to analyze the data would likley be significantly successful.
