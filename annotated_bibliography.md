Chukwuma, Adanna, et al. “Challenges and Opportunities in the Continuity of Care for Hypertension: A Mixed-Methods Study Embedded in a Primary Health Care Intervention in Tajikistan.” BMC Health Services Research, vol. 19, no. 1, Dec. 2019, p. N.PAG. EBSCOhost, doi:10.1186/s12913-019-4779-5.

Heart disease is the leading cause of death in Tajikistan. Early detection and management of hypertension can reduce this. Despite increasing efforts to reduce hypertension since 2010, there a large gaps in treatment now. They used survey data from routine health information systems, household surveys, and a World Bank funded impact evaluation to attempt to collect needed data. Using the information, they created fit-for-purpose solutions to the barriers they uncovered. Detection of hypertension is a necessary step toward proper health management in Tajikistan. Low priority was given hypertension screening, and there was little effort to reach rural communities. To combat this, they implemented the solutions to mobilize faith based groups, scaling up screening through May Measurement Month, leveraging service user interactions with pharmacy, introducing job aids for providers, and task-shifting to increase provider supply. The problems and solutions identified in this paper deal with social opportunities. The fundamental freedom associated with heath increases the evaluative aspect of freedom. Increasing health does not specifically increase or protect agency, but most likely it would enhances the already existing freedoms.
