Nieves uses the random forest method in order to predict population distribution. The random forest method utilyzes existing data that can relate to why humans would locate in a place, such as elevation, slope, groundcover, vegetation, and more. It uses these covariates in tandem with already existing population data to more finely predict population dispersion through machine learning. The random forest method specifically will creates dozens or hundreds of various analysis of the covariates in order to best find the weight and predictive power of the covariates. This allows for a dasymmetric population allocation. At varios geospacial points, the different factors affect the algorithm differently, thus will give a unique prediction. The paper finds that a few specific covariates are very important factors in predicting population distribution. The top factors are urban/suburban extents, (WIP)
