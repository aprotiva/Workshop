Literature Review

The purpose of this research is to improve upon the use of survey data in combination with gridded population data to generate more effective solutions by specifying, estimating, and validating a covariate analysis as compared to a classic statistical model. 

Decreased health due to both limitations of the supply side of health care and patients own limitations actively acts as a detriment to Tajikistan. These limitations prevent Tajikistan most effectively growing and developing as a country. 
	My topic seeks to understand the improper and inefficient capability and use of medical facilities and medical practice, as well as barriers associated with attaining facilities and practice. Improper medical access causes health, economic, social issues, and more. Of these, health is the most obvious. When there is limited access to decent care services, individual’s lifespan decreases and disability increases. Because of this, those individuals can be unable to provide the services they once did. This places an economic burden on those who were once dependents, as well as a burden on the country’s economy. The fewer amount of available people to work and interact, the slower the growth. Unhealthy individuals can become more isolated due to their affliction, and they can become depressed or discouraged from being a functioning member of the community. Inadequate care is a vicious cycle that is detrimental to a community, many of whom are not even directly affected. 
	Heath related harms have been extremely prevalent since the Tajikistani civil war. The war left the state of the country in shambles, presenting harms to the people. The infrastructure in place currently attempts to continue development towards the recovery of the country. Good health and well-being is the third highest sustainable development goal defined by the United Nations. In the words of Amartya Sen, “development is expanding the real freedoms that people enjoy”. By improving the health industry, Tajikistan increases the real freedoms of its people. Tajikistan has made many steps to gather information, analyze, and implement solutions for health system development. 
	The introductory circumstances of health in Tajikistan are vastly complex and unique. From the 2000s to the 2010s, Tajikistan has made large improvements in their health. Tajikistan undertook a civil war before the 2000s, which combined with its ties with the USSR, lead to very poor health conditions. Since the 2000s, Tajikistan has been making steady increases in life expectancy and steady decreases in child mortality.5 Even though things appear to be improving, the countries economic situation in combination with the health systems cause these improvements to be slow.6 Tajikistan sits at a current Human Development score of .656, which ranks 125 out of 189 countries and territories rated by the United Nations Development Program.7 This development score is not very good compared to many of its neighbors like Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan, which sits at a score of .710, and Kazakhstan, which has a score of .817. Tajikistan has one of the lowest developmental scores in Central Asia. Tajikistan has a very low health expenditure in relation to other Central Asian countries, and health inequality is high.6 The Ministry of health, the responsible body for implementation and monitoring of public health in Tajikistan, is aware of their shortcomings and has been attempting to implement health reforms.8 The Health Services Improvement Project was undertaken in the mid to late 2010s, and attempted to decrease health inequality through the use of performance based financing.4, 12 This project resulted in many improvements in utilization and quality of care. The performance-based financing model awards rural health facility with payments depending on the number of provided target services and on a general quality score. This project had successes, but it also shortcomings. The end evaluation found large increases in health infrastructure and equipment. Availability of most drugs and proficiency of care workers increased as well. Important test and exams were conducted more often. On the other hand, far more mediocre results were found for the utilization of health services by the community, though this shortcoming is normal.9 Many different countries have undergone similar projects, though none of which were in Central Asia. Utilization statistics in Tajikistan tend to be high compared to those in Africa, and the regional context is different as well. Even so, the results were similar to the studies conducted in Rwanda, Afghanistan, and Zambia. Many similar studies also find few impacts on the utilization of health services. 
	The Statistical Agency under the President collaborated with the Ministry of Health in order to create and conduct a demographic and health survey.10 The information gathered is intended to assist policymakers and program managers in evaluating and designing programs and strategies for improving health. Most recently, this data has lead Tajikistan to prioritize hypertension.1
	The limitations of the Health Services Improvement Project were mainly demand side. This means that individuals, for whatever reason, did not significantly increase participation in the health services. Progress on active effective coverage will require intervention that better addresses this barrier.9 These barriers may include non-financial barriers, such as accessibility. Three Quarters of the country live in rural areas, and the terrain is mountainous and difficult. This prevents many rural children from receiving the appropriate medical attention.4 In addition, many of the statistics involved have various limitations that hinder their accuracy.6 DHS Spatial Analysis reports can lessen these limitations. These reports supplement Demographic and Health surveys, and provide more data related to the demand side of the market. This analysis utilizes methods such as geostatistical and multivariate statistical techniques, and can enhance the quality and analysis of survey data. 
	Data from DHS surveys are most useful in determining overall health indicators, and less effective at creating precise solutions. These health indicators are very important in determining priorities, but does not help much in creating effective solutions. GPS coordinates combined with DHS data allows for statistical models, like the Bayesian model, to predict at a more precise scale.11 A geospatial technique called Kriging is used in a Bayesian model. Kriging is using already existing data to predict un-sampled data based on a weighting scale of nearby data points. Kriging enhances the accuracy by determining what factors hold what amount of weight in the algorithm. Using this technique in addition to Bayesian Inference allows data to become more precise. Bayesian Inference allows for measures of uncertainty to be included into a corresponding map. These interpolated maps are not perfectly accurate, as they have various measures of uncertainty, but the increase in precision allows decisions to be made more effectively.11
	This type of technique has been effective in other parts of Asia to more accurately use health data in cities.3 Use of World Pop population data as well as Open Street Map data allowed these researchers to conclude that the poorest urban individuals were not adequately represented in survey data, and thus not even being considered for policy implementations. World Pop uses a similar approach as the Bayesian model, but works top down using the random forest model. 
	A similar method, called the “Pattern method”, has been studied and has proven effective at looking at the sustainability of Tajikistan.2 While this is a significantly different context than health, the premise is the same. In order to evaluate sustainability compared to development, this study weighs previously collected indicators, and uses multidimensional comparative analysis to calculate more specific indicators. This covariate analysis proved to be effective in this study. 
	Many conditions present in Tajikistan act as precursors to data science work. Often times, health care providers do not use collected data appropriately.6 Another challenge is the underreporting of births. There is a registration fee for a birth certificate, and many times, census surveys will underreport the poorest.3 There is an absence of modern technology to process patient data, and only around 2-4% of those who did report using a computer used it for keeping patient records. Though these exact numbers are a few years old, it is clear that the use of data in order to make decisions is suboptimal, and more precise information and utilization of data will improve policy implementations. 

This review has provided lots of insight into Tajikistan’s development and implementation of big data. One of the key steps that I noticed is the transition between survey data and big data. Survey data is generally inaccurate or biased, but putting individual sets of data together in order to form more complex relationships can change the essence into big data. I think future work with geospatial data will be very useful. Of course, Tajikistan also has a wealth of other problems that may be a higher priority than maximizing healthcare efficiency through covariate analysis, but the unique geography of Tajikistan may warrant further investigation. Many data science investigations occur in the lower-middle income countries, and geospatial methods have been very prevalent. Tajikistan is in a very mountainous region, thus the intense geography may play an impact into effectiveness of geospatial mapping. What are the shortcomings of geospatially mapping with elevation changes, and how to incorporate more specific elevation and terrain data with less specific population data.
