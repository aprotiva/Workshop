I believe that theory is not dead, yet. Both authors made very good points, but I agree with Kitchen more than Anderson. Rather than destroying theory, big data and data analysis is changing the scope of theory. We don't have to make as many assumptions, and we don't have to guess about the data. This advancement is not taking us away from theory, but bringing us to the next level of theory. I really felt stongly about the points that Kitchen made about how computers don't really understand humans yet. Computers and much better and math and statistics, but a computer can't understand what that math means in the world. It simply is the best at solving the mathmatical calculations and analyzing the data. Computers centainly are better at analysis than humans, but are certainly worse at improving.
