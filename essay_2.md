Geoff West and City of God

The City of God developed in a very unique way based on the social interactions of its individuals. Many different aspects of the City allowed it to grow into a place filled with illegal activities, ruled by gangs. In the beginning, social circumstances caused crime to becoming common. In the early days of the city, it was too far away to be given proper care. This was a main point made in the beginning of the movie. There is less infrastructure, less authority, and less supervison. This situation inherently promotes crime, as crime had the highest economic benefit as well as the social benefit of being known as the "big man" of the community. Crime gave economic benefit as well as authority. 

The economic activity of the City scaled superlinearly, expanding crime by a factor greater than the city itself was expanding. West demonstrates that many aspects of cities grow superliniarly. One of these aspects is economic activity. Because of the economic benefit that crime provided, it began to grow. Specifically, this is when the gangs of the City began truly organizing themselves and moving into the buisness of drugs. Organization increased, profits increased, and total individual participation began increasing at a fast rate. A fundamental change in individual perception changed at this point, with some of the characters attempting to work honestly, but failing due to the economic pressure or other pressure. The situation grew to the point that honest work lagged so far behind organized crime, it was significantly more profitable and accessable to work for a gang. As this occured, individual connections increased superlinearly as well. One of the most imporant is the connection to children. More children began becoming connected to the crime system, and a space in the economic system opened for them as well. 

Another important influence is sublinear scaling of infrastructure expansion. West argues that many of the input requirement of cities follow a sublinear scaling path. This means that as the city grows larger, it becomes more efficient at utilyzing its resources, and doesn't need as many per person. In this context, it means that expansion of crime infrastructure could expand more easily. This is most easily seen in the two large gangs at the end. Nearing the end of the movie, the city had evolved into two rival gangs, Carrot's and Lil Z's, battling over superiority. Both the power of these gangs as well as peer pressure created a place where young children became involved, either by being attracted to the protection and identity, or more often, being roped into to the dilinquent norms through peer pressure or association.

By the end of the movie, I think it would extremely difficult to escape the beast. Rocket did somewhat, but was very lucky, unlike Benny. As shown when Rocket accuses the reporter of stealing his pictures, the cultural norms instilled in those involved are significantly different and critisized by others. Because often times individuals are roped into it, they may have wanted to escape but can't. The overall social networks of the City of God became more and more influential as time went on, and they eventually forced individuals into unfavorable and illegal circumstances.
