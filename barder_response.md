Question: What is a complex adaptive System? What are some of its important features?

When economy and society develop, it develops in a similar way to biological evolution. It is not nessesarily one individuals change, but the aggregate change over time. Barder mentioned an analagy of biology. Society can be compared to an organism, and such if we feed that organism very highly nutricious food, it won't be able to process that efficiently. Only after systematic changes over time can an organism adapt to changing circumstances and develop. The same goes for society and developmental aid. This means that these systems are extremely complicated and generally can't be specifically predicted. The systems are too large and variable to be able to control effectivley. Complex adaptive systems can be influenced, but the outcome will be determined internally within the systems own power. In addition, different systems will respond differently to different influences.

Question: What was the toaster project? What did Thomas Thwaites attempt to do? Was he succcessful? What is the significance of this example in the contect of complexity?

Thwaites attempted to make a functional toaster from scratch. A cheap toaster is very easy to come by in the UK, where Thwaites lived I think. The process of making one from scratch is a different matter entirely. He gathered all of the raw materials from mines and the earth, and after nine months, did actually end up creating a disfunctional toaster. He believed it to be a slight success, I believe otherwise. This portrays the systematic and logistical development of a society. More than simply having all the available resources, toasters are so easy to make now because of the logistical relationship that institutions have with one another. In my words, the logistical and developmental relationship between institutions and a society must be grown, they can not be implanted. A society with strong logistical development but low resources is significantly easier to help develop than one with high resources and low logistical development. Development doesn't happen by telling someone how to make a toaster, because that skips all the essential steps in between. Making the toaster is the goal, but providing one does not help.
