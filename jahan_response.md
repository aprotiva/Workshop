The main points of the talk explained that human development is not measured by how well the economy is doing, or the average income, or even the level of poverty. Human development has many more aspects that need to be considered outside of national, international, and economic analysis. Two aspects of deveopment need to allign with one another. Jahan mentioned that the two variables, capabilities and opportunities to use capabilities, need to remain in equillibrium for maximum effectivness. A balance between the two is destroyed when one simply focuses on one aspect of development, like economic development.
